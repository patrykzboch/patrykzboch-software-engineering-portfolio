## About Me
I am a **MEng Software Engineering** student with a passion for **coding** and **problem-solving**. Throughout my academic career, I've worked on various projects using **Python**, **C#**, **UML**, and other technologies. My goal is to build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications while continuing to learn and grow as a software developer.

## Technologies
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C#, UML

## Projects

### Project 1: Flight Management System
A Flight Management System (FMS) designed to manage flight plans and strips. It integrates with external systems for seamless operation and prioritises security and usability.

### Project 2: Web Browser
A simple C# web browser that sends HTTP requests, displays raw HTML, and supports browsing features such as history and favourites.

### Project 3: Turing Machines
This project explores the design and functionality of **Turing Machines**, complete with detailed descriptions and visualisations. It demonstrates how Turing Machines operate on unary inputs and perform computations using defined state transitions.

### Project 4: Brainwave Team Website
This is a responsive and dynamic website I independently created for my group project to showcase our team's progress and deliverables. The website is live and can be accessed here: [Brainwave Team Website](https://brainwave-team.web.app/).

### Project 5: Machine Learning for Wine Quality Prediction
This Python-based project delves into machine learning and data analysis techniques to predict wine quality based on its chemical properties. It includes:
- **Data Exploration**: Analysis and visualization of key attributes.
- **Clustering**: Identifying patterns using K-Means and hierarchical clustering.
- **Classification Models**: Predicting wine quality using Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Opening the Jupyter Notebook on GitHub automatically runs the code, showing results in real-time.


## How to Use
https://github.com/patrykzboch/patrykzboch-software-engineering-portfolio.git
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patrykzboch/patrykzboch-software-engineering-portfolio.git
2. cd Project-Name
3. Follow project-specific instructions:
- For Jupyter Notebook-based projects (e.g., Machine Learning for Wine Quality Prediction), open the .ipynb file on GitHub or a local Jupyter environment. The notebook -    
  automatically executes and displays results.
-For web-based projects, run:
  npm install
  npm start
- For PDF-based projects, open the PDF directly to view the content.
