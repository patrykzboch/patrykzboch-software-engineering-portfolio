## About Me
I am a **MEng Software Engineering** student with a passion for **coding** and **problem-solving**. Throughout my academic career, I've worked on various projects using **Python**, **C#**, **UML**, **Java**, and other technologies. My goal is to build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications while continuing to learn and grow as a software developer.

## Technologies
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C#, Java

## Projects

### Project 1: Flight Management System
A Flight Management System (FMS) designed to manage flight plans and strips. It integrates with external systems for seamless operation and prioritizes security and usability.

### Project 2: Web Browser
A simple C# web browser that sends HTTP requests, displays raw HTML, and supports browsing features such as history and favourites.

### Project 3: Turing Machines
This project explores the design and functionality of **Turing Machines**, complete with detailed descriptions and visualisations. It demonstrates how Turing Machines operate on unary inputs and perform computations using defined state transitions.

### Project 4: Brainwave Team Website
This is a responsive and dynamic website I independently created for my group project to showcase our team's progress and deliverables. The website is live and can be accessed here: [Brainwave Team Website](https://brainwave-team.web.app/).
